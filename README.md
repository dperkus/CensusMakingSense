Making Sense of Census Data - a brief introduction

In a recent project, I needed to create a clustering model to provide insight into the different segments of our web site users.  We had very little demographic data available in-house.  I knew that the census provides a rich and extensive set of data.  But I quickly learned that there is a huge amount of data available through various methods and it is not easy to figure out how to locate and obtain the "right" set of data.  I will briefly describe how I successfully found, acquired, and used the census data that I needed for my segmentation  project.

I created this presentation for a lightning talk at Metis Data Science Bootcamp 12/14/16 

Here is a notebook with links to resources, instructions.
